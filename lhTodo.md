# TODOs
See `LH TODO`s in code as well

## Bugs

## Now
- Support for more transform types
- Get syntax highlighting on outputs
	- This is a little tricky from UX, not all transforms should inherent the original contents highlighting but its not clear where the boundary is
- Multiple transforms, ie pipe charactor
- Diff-ing of transform outputs

## Long term
- An alt way to show tabs when transforming content
	- Maybe tab groups
	- Would be cool to colour code with sections of transform
- A dedicated transform window, dont hog the infobar while transforming!!
